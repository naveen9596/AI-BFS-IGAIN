## What is Amazon DynamoDB?
✔ Serverless database with no server provisioning, patching, or management required. There's no software to install, maintain, or operate, with zero downtime maintenance.

✔ Global tables provide a multi-Region, multi-active database with up to 99.999% availability SLA, providing you with fast local reads and writes with increased application resilience.

✔ Features include DynamoDB streams for building serverless event-driven applications and zero-ETL integration with Amazon OpenSearch Service for powerful search capabilities without the need to design, build, or maintain complex data pipelines.
✔ Reliability is supported with managed backups, point-in-time recovery, and a broad set of security controls and compliance standards.
