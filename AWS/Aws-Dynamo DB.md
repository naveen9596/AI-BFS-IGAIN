## What is Amazon DynamoDB?
✔ Serverless database with no server provisioning, patching, or management required. There's no software to install, maintain, or operate, with zero downtime maintenance.

✔ Global tables provide a multi-Region, multi-active database with up to 99.999% availability SLA, providing you with fast local reads and writes with increased application resilience.

✔ Features include DynamoDB streams for building serverless event-driven applications and zero-ETL integration with Amazon OpenSearch Service for powerful search capabilities without the need to design, build, or maintain complex data pipelines.
✔ Reliability is supported with managed backups, point-in-time recovery, and a broad set of security controls and compliance standards.

## Use Cases
Develop software applications
Build internet-scale applications supporting user-content metadata and caches that require high concurrency and connections for millions of users and millions of requests per second.
## Create media metadata stores
Scale throughput and concurrency for media and entertainment workloads such as real-time video streaming and interactive content, and deliver lower latency with multi-Region replication across AWS Regions. 
## Deliver seamless retail experiences
Use design patterns for deploying shopping carts, workflow engines, inventory tracking, and customer profiles. DynamoDB supports high-traffic, extreme-scaled events and can handle millions of queries per second.
## Scale gaming platforms
Focus on driving innovation with no operational overhead. Build out your game platform with player data, session history, and leaderboards for millions of concurrent users.
