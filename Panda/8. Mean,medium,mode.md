### Descriptive statistics provide a summary of the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of a datasetâ€™s distribution. Here is an example using a simple dataset to calculate the mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation:

### Example Dataset
Let's consider the following dataset:
\[ 4, 8, 6, 5, 3, 8, 7, 9, 5, 8 \]

3. **Mode**
   - The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset.
   - In this dataset, the number 8 appears three times.

### Summary of Descriptive Statistics

- **Mean:** 6.3
- **Median:** 6.5
- **Mode:** 8
- **Variance:** 4.01
- **Standard Deviation:** 2.00

These calculations provide a concise summary of the central tendency and variability of the dataset.
